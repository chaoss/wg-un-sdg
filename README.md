# Background
The second annual UN OSPOs for Good conference was held in July of 2024.  There was a belief stated in that group of approximately 700 open source advocates that Open Source Software (OSS) and open source comunities are a great place to address the UN SDGs.  A challenge was made at the end of the conference to identify the impact OSS is having on the UN SDGs.  This working group is a direct response to that challenge and we hope to define standards and develop capabilites to enable OSS projects to capture when/if their projects are addressing the UN SDGs.

# Contributing
This project is open to anyone interested in helping to define how to measure if Open Source Software (OSS) projects are addressing the [United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).  We encourage all types of contributors, not just coders.  Here are a few good steps as good starting points in connecting with the UN SDG WG:
 - Join us on our weekly video conferences.
 - Review the [issue list](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-un-sdg/issues) and fix some of the issues.
